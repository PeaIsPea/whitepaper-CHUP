# 🌍 CHUP: Multi-Kingdom Open World Web3 Game

**CHUP** is a Web3 open-world multiplayer RPG set across four distinct kingdoms: **Colony**, **Homestead**, **Utopia**, and **Paragon**. Players explore 40 unique maps, fight in PvE & PvP arenas, upgrade NFT weapons, and participate in kingdom-wide battles — all driven by a dual-token economy and deep profession system.
