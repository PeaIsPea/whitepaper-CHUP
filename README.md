# CHUP: Elemental Conquest â€“ Web3 Battle Royale with Core Skills

## Project Description

Welcome to CHUP, an expansive open world divided into four distinct kingdoms: Colony, Homestead, Utopia, and Paragon. Each kingdom is not just a name but a starting point for players' unique adventures and experiences. CHUP offers a vast world and a perfect blend of PvP (Player versus Player) and PvE (Player versus Environment) mechanics.

## Gameplay Features

* **Expansive World:** Explore a world with 40 maps, including 4 main kingdom maps and 36 diverse combat maps accessible via portals.
* **Engaging PvP and PvE:** Participate in intense battles against other players or team up to conquer PvE challenges, defeat monsters, and overcome difficult levels in combat maps. Rewards include tokens, shared among team members or earned individually.
* **Diverse Character and Profession System:** Start as a normal individual and choose from a rich system of professions at character creation, determining your "nationality". Each profession has unique skill strengths (e.g., doctor, blacksmith, hunter, athlete). Gain experience to upgrade weapons and personal skills.
* **Karma / Reputation System:** Bad players (excessive PK, betraying guilds) are marked, making it difficult to enter other kingdoms and increasing prices from merchants.
* **"One Life" Mechanic:** A core element where dying results in losing all items (lootable by others or reclaimed by the system after 15 minutes). New characters start at level 1 but gain x2 experience initially to catch up quickly. This encourages cautious combat decisions.

## World Overview

The world of CHUP consists of 4 main kingdom maps and 36 combat maps.
* Kingdom areas are safe zones where fighting is strictly prohibited.
* Combat maps are where players can freely engage in PvP and PvE. These maps have unique terrains and features, embodying the motto "kill or be killed".

## In-Game Economy (Tokens & NFTs)

* **$PHC (Primary Hub Coin):** The main currency for player-to-player transactions and trading NFTs (weapons, clothing, tools). Earned by completing missions or defeating other players.
* **$PCOIN (Primary Coin):** Used to upgrade character skill stats and enhance items, primarily NFTs. Obtained by participating in kingdom professions (animal husbandry, farming, delivery, hunting) or defeating monsters in combat maps.
* **Token Burning Mechanism:** A 5% gas fee for each $PHC transaction and a certain amount of $PCOIN used for item upgrades are burned to control inflation.

## NFTs & Legendary Weapons

* NFTs include weapons, clothing, and tools that players can freely buy, sell, and own.
* Weapons start at level 0 and can be upgraded to level 100 using $PCOIN. Level changes affect the weapon's color display:
    * Level 0-10: Brown
    * Level 11-20: White
    * Level 21-30: Yellow
    * Level 31-40: Cyan
    * Level 41-50 (Max): Orange
* **Legendary Weapons:** Three unique, legendary (level 100) weapons are randomly dropped by the publisher in the 36 combat maps. These are one-of-a-kind and cannot be copied:
    * **CP-115 (Rank 3):** A shapeshifting weapon with near-absolute destructive power.
    * **Syntax Orb (Rank 2):** Allows the owner to teleport anywhere on the server.
    * **(Rank 1):** An unrevealed mystery, promising to be the most powerful item.
* Legendary weapons can be traded between players.
* Item Drop Transparency: Publicly trackable and verifiable legendary weapon drop events on the blockchain using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to ensure randomness and fairness.

## Fairness & New Player Experience

* Players level 1-20 are considered "new players" and can only accept level 1-10 missions in separate PvE maps (no PvP), earning only $PCOIN. Leveling up in this phase grants 1 $PHC and 1000 $PCOIN per level.
* $PHC is only rewarded for completing missions in maps with both PvP and PvE.
* Upon reaching level 20, players are considered ready for PvP situations.
* Strict control over NFT supply and clear power differences between NFTs ensure balance between paying players and free players, following the motto "play to earn, not pay to win".
* High-level weapon upgrades (level 41-50) carry risk and consume both $PCOIN and a small amount of $PHC, increasing rarity and preventing players from reaching maximum gear too easily.

## Web3 Integration

* Convenient Web3 Wallet Integration: Guest login system with later wallet linking for easy access and familiarity with Web3 technology.
* Future Governance DAO: Empower the community through a DAO system, allowing players to vote on events, new maps, item drop limits, etc.
* Integration of NFTs and digital assets to protect the value of players' time and skills.

## Community Development and Expansion

* Nationality and Guilds: Each kingdom has its own nationality, forming a strong basis for community development by region or guild. A kingdom can have multiple different guilds.
* Inter-Kingdom Events: Large-scale events between kingdoms like war zones, resource raids, and national wars. During these events, the four kingdom maps merge into one special combat map. Players do not lose items upon death, and kingdom resources change based on battle outcomes. Guilds within the same kingdom must unite for common interests.
* Guild System and Profession Rankings: Develop a strong guild system and rankings for each profession to increase competitiveness and long-term player retention.

## Anti-Cheat Measures Using AI

CHUP aims for a completely fair and secure gaming environment by deploying an advanced anti-cheat system integrating AI and machine learning to detect, prevent, and handle cheating behaviors in real-time.

* **Intelligent Behavior Monitoring System:** Uses AI to learn and build normal player behavior models based on movement speed, attack rate, hit/kill ratio in PvE, reaction time in PvP, and interaction patterns with NPCs. Any behavior outside the normal threshold is flagged.
* **Bot Detection System:** A machine learning system trained to distinguish real players from bots through mouse/finger movement patterns, keypress frequency, and long-term behavior changes. The system will also randomly require players to perform micro-validation tasks in suspicious situations.
* **AI Analyzing Blockchain Data:** Monitors NFT and token transactions to detect economic anomalies like high-frequency item transfers between linked wallets, repeated transactions at unreasonable prices, and unnatural token farming loops.
* **"Zero Tolerance" Mechanism:** Upon detecting cheating behavior, accounts may be permanently disabled, fraudulent NFTs frozen, and in less severe cases, players' reputation may be reduced, affecting kingdom access or restricting professional activities during verification.
* **Integrated AI Edge Computing:** Uses edge-based AI models embedded directly in the game client for early detection of auto-clickers, injectors, and cheat engines, reducing latency and saving resources.

## Development Roadmap (MVP)

CHUP will be developed in clear segments to ensure feasibility and test core experience quality before expansion.

### Stage 1: MVP Launch (Minimum Viable Product)
* A single Kingdom (e.g., Colony) as the starting point.
* 4 initial Maps: 2 PvE, 1 mixed PvE/PvP, 1 controlled PvP training map.
* 1 Profession/Character Class unlocked (e.g., Hunter).
* Minimum Web3 integration: Wallet connect after guest login, $PCOIN token, basic NFT weapons.

### Development & Community Testing Segments
* **PvE Testing (Closed Alpha):** Focus on missions, monsters, AI, $PCOIN rewards, individual and team experience, balancing items, drop rates, and profession stats.
* **PvP Testing (Limited Open Beta PvP):** Activate PvP in mixed maps, test player damage, skill interactions, "One Life" mechanic, and measure server performance during large engagements.
* **Guild & DAO Integration (Late Beta Stage):** Open guild system and profession rankings, allow players to vote on initial test events via DAO, and launch the first internal NFT marketplace.
